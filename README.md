# MATLABPlots

This package implements a thin wrapper over the
(MATLAB.jl)[https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl] to provide a MATLAB
plotting interface from the comfort of Julia. For example,

```julia
x = range(0, stop=2Ï€, length=201)
y = sin.(x)
plot(x, y, ".-")
```

At the moment only a few of the MATLAB plotting functions are wrapped. More may
be added in time as needs arise. The functions wrapped so far are

* `figure`
* `clf`
* `plot`
    * Note: only style specification is possible; additional arguments in the
      `plot(x, y, style, "Keyword", "Value")` MATLAB style are not recognised yet.
	* `plot` is overloaded to plot in 3D if a `z` variable is passed.
* `plot!`
    * This plots with the hold set to true.
